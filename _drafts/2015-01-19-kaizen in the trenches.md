Building a product using lean practices can be a wonderful experience for a software team.
We begin to see reduced lead times to delivery, greater alignment to business needs and with a good return on investment.

To do this a team must be disruptive, continually pivoting and acting quickly to identify waste.
How does a team begin to adopt a such a culture?

### Kaizen
A business philosophy formed in Japan by Toyota, Kaizen literally means *"continuous improvement"*.
This is a full team effort, in Toyota participation is close to 100 percent
with each employee expected to offer at least one suggestion per year for improvement.

In the software world Kaizen means striving for goals such as:

* Reduced number of defects
* Faster delivery
* Increased customer satisfaction
* Faster recovery from disasters
* Elimination of waste which impedes delivery

### Adopting Kaizen
In order to adopt Kaizen a team must first understand the importance of achieving a sustainable pace at delivering software.
If the team is operating at their maximum capacity or worst yet beyond,
they will never be able to reflect on their current situation and learn to grow.

To achieve such a pace we need to control the amount of work flowing through the system to match the capacity of the team.

### Eat, sleep, measure, repeat
