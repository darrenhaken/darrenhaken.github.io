title: Kaizen in the trenches
---
A super star team is disruptive, continually evolving and acting quickly to identify waste.
But how does a team begin to make this part of their DNA?

### Kaizen
A business philosophy formed in Japan by Toyota, Kaizen literally means *"continuous improvement"*.
This really resonates with me, I firmly believe if we aren't trying to improve ourselves then we risk becoming complacent and inevitably slowing down our progress.

This is a full team effort! In Toyota participation is close to 100 percent with each employee expected to offer at least one suggestion per year for improvement.
Without experimenting and taking risks to improve, we miss potential opportunities for greatness.
Even if things don't quite work out as we planned, failure is still an opportunity to learn for our next experiment!

In the software world I've seen teams embrace Kaizen in many ways including:

* Reducing the number of defects
* Faster delivery
* Increased customer satisfaction
* Faster recovery from disasters
* Elimination of waste which impedes delivery

### Adopting Kaizen
In order to adopt Kaizen it's important to try and *visualise your process* and strive for a *sustainable pace* at delivering software.

On projects I've worked on we use a physical board to visualise our process, which starts from customer requests and ends when they're released into the wild.
We refer to this as our value stream. It's important we visualise our value stream as humans tend to be really good at processing information when using visual aids.
We are also incredibly skilled at forgetting things, visual cues are great reminders and an easy way to digest information.

Here is an example of a project board:

By visualising your value stream you can:

* Quickly see all the work in progress
* Spot impediments/blockers preventing a feature from being delivered
* Improve communication between team members
* Begin to make changes and visually see how it impacts your project

The last point is key here, I want as many opportunities as I can to see how our next experiment impacts the project.

##### Why the sustainable pace, shouldn't I be working at my full capacity?
I've often seen teams become obsessed with 100% utilisation, largely due to focusing on velocity as the means of measuring the teams success.
However this comes at a price, flexibility. If the team is maxed out they can't quickly respond to change, they already have too much to handle!

We need to control the amount of work flowing through the system to match the teams capacity.
Kanban is often used hand-in-hand with Kaizen and focuses on *limiting your work in progress (WIP)*.

The project board shows WIP limits as red bars marked below each column of the value stream.
For example there is a limit of 2 features that can be implemented concurrently in development, which matches to the two developer pairs on the project.

Controlling WIP allows the opportunity to control demand (only slightly!) and allocate time to incorporate experiments into the team.

For example what if the developers could have an afternoon per week where they reached out for feedback from our users?
We can then incorporate what we learn into future development, we might even increase our user base.
It might sound crazy but experiments like this are often breakthroughs for the project.

### Measuring is key
To understand the impact to change, we need to measure and validate our successes and failures.
Remember failures are also another opportunity and learn with our next experiment!

I'll focus here on the goal of delivering faster which in Kanban is usually tracked using lead time (also known as cycle time) of a feature.

###Final Thoughts
Embrace Kaizen and tell me in the comments below some of the breakthroughs you've had by trying it.
In future posts I'll cover some of the experiments I've observed.
