Visualising work provides huge benefits when developing a product.


In agile teams, it's common to visualise our value stream using a project board.
It's an information radiator, helping us manage priorities and swarm on problems blocking delivery.
I'm actually a huge fan of the project board being physical rather than electronic.
It's an evolving artifact, constantly changing along with the team.
Something I can touch allows me to mould it to exactly what's needed.


Considering how much value we get from the board, I'm often surprised that we don't often apply it to other aspects of the project.
The big question I started to ask is why don't we visualise the bigger picture?
Something that a stakeholder could walk past and immediately understand exactly what direction we're moving towards.

### Agile transformation map

So I started to think of a method to visualise the projects priorities at a strategic level.

Key considerations were:

* Low fidelity - it must be easy to setup and not have a high management overhead
* Useful both internally and externally - both to the project team and stakeholders
* Provide an understanding of whether big feature areas are aligned with the companies goals
* Highlight any key information such as third party dependencies, hard deadlines
