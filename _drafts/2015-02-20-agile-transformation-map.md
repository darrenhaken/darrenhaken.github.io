Visualising work provides huge benefits when developing a product.


In agile teams, it's common to visualise our value stream using a project board.
It's an information radiator, helping us manage priorities and swarm on problems blocking delivery.
I'm actually a huge fan of the project board being a physical artifact.
It's an evolving artifact, constantly changing along with the team.
Something I can touch allows me to mould it to exactly what's needed.


Considering how much value I've seen this offer, I'm often surprised that we don't apply to other concerns of the project.
The big question is, why don't we visualise the bigger picture of the project?

Something that our product owner could walk past and immediately understand exactly what direction we moving towards.

Something to see the project at a strategic level.

Something the product owner can wander past in the office and at a glance understand what direction we are moving in.
