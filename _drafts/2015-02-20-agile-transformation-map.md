Visualising your value stream provides huge benefits when delivering a project.
Acting as an information radiator, it helps the team manage priorities and remove blockers.


I'm actually a big fan of a physical board rather than an electronic system.
Something to touch allows the team to mould it to exactly what's needed.
It's an evolving artifact, constantly changing along with the team.

Considering how much value project boards give, I'm often surprised teams aren't applying it to other parts of the project.


What about something to visualise the bigger picture?


Something that a stakeholder could walk past and immediately understand if we're on track to succeeding at our vision.


A tool to quickly understand the strategic priorities of the project.

### Agile transformation map

A transformation map is a visual tool used in workshops to establish a plan for implementing goal.
Each quadrant represents a stream of work and each item a major activity/milestone that supports the goal.

We all know plans change so the obvious evolution of this idea is to turn the map into a living document.
This means that whenever priorities change we update the map to reflect this.
For example if you had a milestone to 'build a new customer portal' scheduled in 6 months time and it's changed to 3 months; the map should reflect this.

On my current project we have a transformation map prominently next to our project board.
What this gives the team is a view of the 'big picture' and the day to activities all in one place.
We've actually extended our daily stand up ritual to give the team regular updates at a much higher level than just the project board.

Key benefits are:

#### Low ceremony
It must be easy to setup and with little overhead to manage.
No matter how useful a tool is, the moment it becomes a maintenance nightmare people tend to forget to use it.  

#### Valuable to both the project and leadership teams
By supporting multiple audiences it builds alignment between the team and their stakeholders.
The project team can understand that the the user stories support the goals of the business.
Stakeholders can visually see how much progress has been made to towards the vision they set out to achieve.

#### Highlight key information
The transformation map shows the various deliverables which need to be met in order for the business to succeed.
I've found that by using
Such as third party dependencies, hard deadlines

I'd love for other teams to try this out and give me some input on ways I could improve this idea.
